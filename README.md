# Homemade VPN

## Objective
To deploy and configure a secure/self-hosted VPN server using WireGuard on a cloud-based linux VPS. This project enabled secure encrypted tunneling of client internet traffic, managed routing and firewall settings, and enhanced hands-on skills in cloud server administration, VPN security, and network troubleshooting.

### Skills Learned
- Deployed and managed a Linux-based VPS on DigitalOcean.
- Installed and configured a WireGuard VPN server and client for encrypted traffic tunneling.
- Generated and managed cryptographic key pairs (Private/Public keys) for secure connections.
- Configured full IP forwarding and NAT (Network Address Translation) using iptables.
- Troubleshooted DNS and network routing issues

### Tools Used
- WireGuard (for VPN server and client configuration)
- DigitalOcean (cloud platform for VPS deployment)
- Ubuntu Linux (operating system for the cloud VPS)
- SSH/Secure Shell (for secure remote server access)

## Steps
- Deployed and connected to a cloud VPS (Ubuntu Linux).
- Installed and configured WireGuard VPN on the server.
- Created and exchanged cryptographic key pairs.
- Set up IP forwarding, NAT, and firewall rules with iptables.
- Configured and activated the VPN client on macOS.
- Tested, verified, and troubleshooted VPN connection and DNS issues.
